### 3. Compound Risk Analysis Service (`compound-risk.service.ts`)

**Purpose**: Advanced multi-dimensional risk correlation and exponential scoring.

**Key Algorithms**:

#### Exponential Risk Scoring
```typescript
finalScore = (baseScore × exponentialFactor) + synergyBonus
exponentialFactor = 1.3^(highRiskConditions - 1)
synergyBonus = Σ(risk1 × risk2 × correlation × synergyFactor) / 100
```

#### Medical Synergies
- **Diabetes + Cardiovascular**: 2.5x multiplier (Evidence Level A)

#### Brazilian Socioeconomic Risk Factors
- **SUS Dependency**: 1.2x multiplier
- **Rural Location**: 1.3x multiplier
- **Low Education**: 1.25x multiplier
- **Social Isolation**: 1.4x multiplier
- **Family Support**: 0.85x protective factor

### 4. Temporal Risk Tracking Service (`temporal-risk-tracking.service.ts`)

**Purpose**: Longitudinal health risk analysis with predictive modeling.

**Features**:
- Risk velocity calculation (points/day)
- Acceleration detection (change in velocity)
- Seasonal pattern recognition
- Intervention impact analysis
- Predictive trajectory modeling

**Alert Thresholds**:
- **Velocity**: >5 points/day = escalation
- **Acceleration**: >2 points/day² = notification
- **Absolute Score**: >80 = emergency
- **Pattern Change**: Stable→Rapid decline = escalation

### 5. Advanced Risk Controller (`advanced-risk-controller.ts`)

**Purpose**: RESTful API orchestration for comprehensive risk assessment.

**Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/advanced-risk/assess` - Full risk assessment
- `POST /api/advanced-risk/emergency` - Emergency reassessment
- `GET /api/advanced-risk/temporal/:userId` - Temporal analysis
- `GET /api/advanced-risk/user/:userId/summary` - Risk dashboard

```

### 3. Emergency Detection
```
Rule-Based Screening → Severity Classification → Escalation Protocol → Automated Actions
```

### 4. Recommendation Generation
```
Evidence-Based Guidelines → Risk Level Mapping → Personalized Recommendations → Follow-up Scheduling
```
