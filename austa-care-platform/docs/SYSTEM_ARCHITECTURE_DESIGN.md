## 10. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### ADR-001: Event-Driven Architecture with Apache Kafka

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-07-14

**Context:**
The AUSTA Care Platform requires real-time processing of health events, user interactions, and system notifications. Traditional request-response patterns would create tight coupling between services and limit scalability.

**Decision:**
Implement event-driven architecture using Apache Kafka as the primary event streaming platform.

**Consequences:**
- ‚úÖ Loose coupling between microservices
- ‚úÖ Better scalability and fault tolerance
- ‚úÖ Real-time analytics and monitoring

### ADR-002: Multi-Cloud Strategy (AWS Primary, GCP Disaster Recovery)

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-07-14

**Context:**
Healthcare applications require maximum availability and disaster recovery capabilities. Single cloud dependency creates risk of vendor lock-in and catastrophic failure.

**Decision:**
Deploy primary workloads on AWS with disaster recovery on Google Cloud Platform.

**Consequences:**
- ‚úÖ Reduced vendor lock-in risk
- ‚úÖ Better disaster recovery capabilities
- ‚úÖ Negotiation leverage with cloud providers

- ‚ùå Higher operational costs

### ADR-003: Polyglot Persistence Strategy

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-07-14

**Context:**
Different data patterns require different storage solutions. Healthcare data includes structured transactional data, unstructured documents, time-series data, and graph relationships.

**Decision:**
Use multiple database technologies optimized for specific use cases:
- PostgreSQL for transactional data
- MongoDB for document storage
- Redis for caching and sessions
- Data Lake for analytics

**Consequences:**
- ‚úÖ Optimal performance for each data type
- ‚úÖ Flexibility in data modeling
- ‚úÖ Scalability for different workloads
- ‚ùå Increased operational complexity
- ‚ùå Need for specialized expertise

### ADR-004: Kubernetes-Native Deployment

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-07-14

**Context:**

**Decision:**
Deploy all services on Kubernetes with GitOps deployment using ArgoCD.

**Consequences:**
- ‚úÖ Container orchestration and auto-scaling
- ‚úÖ Declarative infrastructure management
- ‚úÖ Rolling deployments with zero downtime
- ‚ùå Learning curve for development teams
- ‚ùå Additional infrastructure complexity

### ADR-005: Fine-Tuned GPT-4 for Medical Conversations

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-07-14

**Context:**
General-purpose language models may not have sufficient accuracy for medical symptom analysis and healthcare conversations.

**Decision:**
Use OpenAI GPT-4 as the base model with healthcare-specific fine-tuning for Portuguese medical conversations.

**Consequences:**
- ‚úÖ High accuracy for medical conversations
- ‚úÖ Faster implementation vs building from scratch
- ‚úÖ Regular model updates from OpenAI
- ‚ùå Dependency on external API
- ‚ùå Costs scale with usage
